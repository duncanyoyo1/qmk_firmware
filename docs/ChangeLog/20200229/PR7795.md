* GON NerD codebase refactor
  * Splits the codebase for GON NerD 60 and NerdD TKL PCBs into two separate directories.
  * If your keymap is for a NerD 60 PCB, your `make` command is now `make gon/nerd60:<keymap>`.
  * If your keymap is for a NerD TKL PCB, your `make` command is now `make gon/nerdtkl:<keymap>`.
