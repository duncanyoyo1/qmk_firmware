* Moving backlight keycode handling to `process_keycode/`
    * This refactors the backlight keycode logic to be clearer and more modular.
    * All backlight-related keycodes are now actioned in a single file.
    * The `ACTION_BACKLIGHT_*` macros have also been deleted. If you are still using these in a `fn_actions[]` block, please switch to using the backlight keycodes or functions directly.
