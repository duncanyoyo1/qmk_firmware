* Adding support for `BACKLIGHT_ON_STATE` for hardware PWM backlight
    * Previously, the define only affected software PWM, and hardware PWM always assumed an N-channel MOSFET.
    * The hardware PWM backlight setup has been updated to respect this option.
    * The default "on" state has been changed to `1` - **this impacts all keyboards using software PWM backlight that do not define it explicitly**. If your keyboard's backlight is acting strange, it may have a P-channel MOSFET, and will need to have `#define BACKLIGHT_ON_STATE 0` added to the keyboard-level `config.h`. Please see the PR for more detailed information.
